							When most liquids are cooled, they eventually freeze and form crystalline solids, solids in which the atoms, ions, or molecules are
							arranged in a definite repeating pattern. It is also possible for a liquid to freeze before its molecules become arranged in an
							orderly pattern. The resulting materials are called amorphous solids or noncrystalline solids (or, sometimes, glasses). The
							particles of such solids lack an ordered internal structure and are randomly arranged

							Metals and ionic compounds typically form ordered, crystalline solids. Substances that consist of large molecules, or a mixture of
							molecules whose movements are more restricted, often form amorphous solids. For examples, candle waxes are amorphous solids composed
							of large hydrocarbon molecules. Some substances, such as silicon dioxide (shown in Figure 2), can form either crystalline or
							amorphous solids, depending on the conditions under which it is produced. Also, amorphous solids may undergo a transition to the
							crystalline state under appropriate conditions.

							Ionic solids, such as sodium chloride and nickel oxide, are composed of positive and negative ions that are held together by
							electrostatic attractions, which can be quite strong (Figure 3). Many ionic crystals also have high melting points. This is due to
							the very strong attractions between the ions—in ionic compounds, the attractions between full charges are (much) larger than those
							between the partial charges in polar molecular compounds. This will be looked at in more detail in a later discussion of lattice
							energies. Although they are hard, they also tend to be brittle, and they shatter rather than bend. Ionic solids do not conduct
							electricity; however, they do conduct when molten or dissolved because their ions are free to move. Many simple compounds formed by
							the reaction of a metallic element with a nonmetallic element are ionic.

							>> Frenkel defect : This type of defect is created when an ion leaves its appropriate site in the lattice and occupies an
							interstitial site. A hole or vacancy is thus produced in the lattice. The electroneutrality of the crystal is maintained since the
							number of positive and negative ions is the same. Since positive ions are small, in size, they usually leave their positions in the
							lattice and occupy interstitial positions. It is also called dislocation defect. Frenkel defect is exhibited in ionic compounds in
							which the radius ratio [r+/r–] is low. The cations and anions differ much in their sizes and the ions have low co-ordination
							numbers. Examples are ZnS, AgBr, AgI, AgCl.
